# Space Prison 14!

SP14 is a soft fork of space station 14 that puts a twist on the standard ss14 experience by putting staff in charge of ~~mis~~managing their very own prison!



Players can attempt escapes to join the liberation as prisoners, try to quell the tide as staff members or co-ordinate planned assaults as liberators.

## What's new?

-Custom prison maps.

-Redesigned departments and roles.

-Liberator syndicate faction.

-Custom Antag roles e.g. Smuggler.



## What to expect?

as the roundflow will not be too dissimilar from a game of SS14 it's very likely the rules will not change very dramatically from the base game. 

Prisoners will have much more lenient antagonism rules and likely will be considered **some kind** of free agent.

We are designing the fork from an MRP perspective and as such want to provide both a fun roleplay and gameplay experience.


### :warning:We Are currently in early development:warning: 

A lot of planned features are in the works and playtests have yet to be announced. 

We decided to open the server to the public to discuss ideas and balancing with a potential playerbase.

Space Station 14 is a remake of SS13 that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), our homegrown engine written in C#.

This is the primary repo for Space Station 14. To prevent people forking RobustToolbox, a "content" pack is loaded by the client and server. This content pack contains everything needed to play the game on one specific server.

If you want to host or create content for SS14, this is the repo you need. It contains both RobustToolbox and the content pack for development of new content packs.
